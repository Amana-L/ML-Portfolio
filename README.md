# Machine Learning Projects
A collection of machine learning projects I have done.

## House Price Estimator
**The Problem** - predict house prices given features that are both categories and numerical. 

**The Solution** - the model used is a Random Forest Regression method using Scikit-Learn, whilst data processing is done using Pandas.
